# Requencer

A 4-track eurorack-style step sequencer prototype running in the browser. Each track has independent gate, pitch, velocity and mod subtracks with per-subtrack length and clock dividers. Outputs are freely routable, and a built-in randomizer generates musically useful patterns using euclidean rhythms and scale-quantized pitch.

## Controls

Keyboard-driven with eurorack-style hold combos. Hold a track button (1-4) + encoder arrows to edit length and clock dividers. Hold a track button + D to randomize that track. Double-click or double-tap any holdable button to lock it in "sticky hold" — interact one-handed, then tap again or press Escape to release. Press `?` for the full keymap.
